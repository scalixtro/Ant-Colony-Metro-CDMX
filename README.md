## Description

In the main page, a simplified version of the Mexico's City subway system is shown. The user choose the start and end stations either by clicking on the station nodes or by writing their names in the text boxes. After choosing the two stations, the user must click on the button with the text `Encontrar ruta`. When this happen, the ACO algorithm starts searching for the best route based on the closest path. When the algorithm finish the number of epochs, the best route found is displayed in a new page. Then, the user can search for a new path.
